UG-ANTS: How to Contribute
==========================

Reporting Bugs
--------------

To report bugs/issues please email miao@metoffice.gov.uk and ideally open an
associated `bug report
<https://github.com/MetOffice/UG-ANTS/issues/new?template=bug-report.md>`_
on GitHub as well.

To support the UG-ANTS developers in identifying the problem, please provide:

* a recipe for repeating - what command/routine was called and with what
  arguments/inputs?
* any error message text output
* the version of UG-ANTS being used
* the version of the contrib code being used, if applicable
* if making a change to core or contrib, branches checked into the repository.
  Please provide links and revision numbers.

Due to the complexity of some workflows it can be hard to understand what
is being run/intended, so when providing a recipe for repeating your issue
please try and provide details of the script(s) being run and the inputs and
arguments being used beyond just a pointer to "task X in suite Y".

Feature Requests
----------------

We welcome input from our users on things that could make ANTS more useful,
easier to use, or add functionality that is missing for your desired ancillary
generation processes. If you would like to request an enhancement or behaviour
change please get in contact, describing the use case in detail and ideally open
an associated `feature request
<https://github.com/MetOffice/UG-ANTS/issues/new?template=feature-request.md>`_
on GitHub as well.

Contribute Code
---------------

All contributions to UG-ANTS are made via merges with the ``main``
branch of https://github.com/MetOffice/UG-ANTS.

New contributors to UG-ANTS must agree to the following Contributor Licence
Agreement (CLA), and add their name and institution to the list of contributors.

The CLA below supercedes the CLA that was previously used on the Met Office
Science Repository Service (MOSRS). Contributors who have previously contributed
code to ANTS via MOSRS must agree to the new CLA by adding their name and
institution to the list of contributors.

UG-ANTS uses `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`_ hooks.
If you are a first-time contributor, you may need to run the following command
once to install ``pre-commit`` into your local git repository::

    pre-commit install

You may need to activate an environment containing ``pre-commit`` before running.
